     <H5 style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">Thesis</H5>
     <hr>
     <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For my Thesis research, I returned to some of the papers about digital Nomads that I received in Week 3. I originally wanted to look at digital nomads as a means of exploring the idea of working anywhere and quickly realised that it had some interesting parallels with the experience of working from home where lines between life and work become blurred. I read a paper called ‘The Freedom Trap’ which focused in on the illusion of freedom that digital nomads seek which ironically results in more difficulty separating life from work. The digital Nomads have to go to great lengths to create a distinction between the two and in some cases end up working longer and more intensely from the pressure to maintain their brand. The digital Nomads are often forced to intensely monitor time in order to find time for their own life. It looked at how digital Nomads are dissolving boundaries between travel, work and leisure by going to tourist spots and trying to work in them. The digital Nomads often romanticize the lifestyle making some interviews less reliable as they tend to focus on the positive aspects. The paper did an Ethnographic study which surprisingly led to disciplining strategies being an integral part of the results which was a surprise to the Nomads and the investigator. </p>
       <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> The article research started to identify that digital Nomads indirectly seek out structure and found that they couldn’t escape some of the tropes and values of the conventional office space. Shared office space were often considered an essential aspect for digital Nomads to be productive, creating a physical boundary between work and leisure as well as opting to primarily use Laptops over mobile devices as a less distracting method of working. There was a sense that productivity is of the upmost importance and structure was an essential part of achieving this. It pointed out that working late or into the evening was what they aimed to avoid but this wasn’t always the case based on workload and colleague time zones. The paper also noted a taboo around taking calls in the public workspace and that although Digital Nomads opted for this public workspace, they would often avoid interaction and would prioritise workspaces where they weren’t sitting across from others. The paper also found that some digital nomads that were travelling and working alone experienced a strong sense of isolation and that when alone it was often harder to find delineation between work and leisure. They found that couples worked with a better sense of structure and work life division as the partners understood one another’s rhythm and would often intervene if they felt the other was working too hard and reminded them to take a break. They also noted that Nomads often changed their view on deadlines after time on the road, understanding the sense of structure that it can create. This is something the more entrepreneurial Nomads couldn’t enjoy, requiring self-imposed time management techniques. Some used a wide variety of project management techniques, including Agile,Footnote3 SprintsFootnote4 and timeboxing.Footnote5. They paper noted the lengths that digital nomads went to in order to avoid distractions with one participant having gotten a programmer to write a system that would lock him out of certain apps until he had put down 4.5 hours of work. </p>

        <hr>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, the topic was smart cities, and it was run by Ayoola, Savannah, Thomas and Arun. This would be the final class workshop run by students. Ayoola spoke about INSERT TOPIC, Savannah spoke about INSERT TOPIC, Thomas spoke about Neuralink and finally Arunraj spoke about Finance relating to smart cities. The presentation explored some interesting topics in relation to smart cities. After the presentation, we moved into some activities. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">I worked with Kade and Cian for the group activities where we had to come up with problems based in urban areas. We then had to agree on the one issue we’d like to solve. We agreed that transport and in particular issues related to cycling would be our topic. The next activity was a continuation of this where we had to create an empathy map based on our issue. Cian had to leave at this point so myself and Kade came up with an empathy map based on a character named Laura who was cycling to work in Dublin city every day. Finally, we worked on creating a product solution to our problem and then coming up with a story based on this product as well as potential future enhancements. We settled on a smart helmet which would direct cyclists through the safest route in the least distracting way, makes cyclists more visible, has indicators and could one day be integrated with EEG Sensors. The seminar was really engaging, and the activities used some interesting methods for exploring ideas. </p>

        <hr>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, it was our turn to host the workshop. My group included Shalvi, Fionn and Cian. Our topic was Artificial Intelligence. I chose to work on this topic as I believed it could have some interesting material related to working from home. We started working together on Miro, a similar software to mural where we posted some topics and presentation flow ideas. We used this to agree on topics that we would each cover in the presentation. I decided to look at the workplace in general as this is a big topic in AI and I felt that this would still be interesting in relation to my Thesis. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">Once we’d agreed on our presentation topic’s we started discussing the activities further. We wanted to try and do something new this week and considering that AI can be a divisive topic, we organized a debate. We added a short activity that prompted attendees to look around the room, pick an object, imagine it had a mind or autonomy and talk about how it might behave. During our planning sessions we discussed some deepfake software and a website that could make fake faces using AI. We were taken aback at how real some of the faces looked so we thought it would be a fun activity to show faces and ask the class if they thought they were human, or AI generated. Finally, we had a INSERT ACTIVITY that we would do depending on time. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">On the day of our presentation we met beforehand to review our slides and doublecheck that we were prepared for everything. Later that day we kicked off the workshop. Shalvi presented first covering INSERT TOPIC. I followed and presented about AI in the workplace. Fionn was next. He started with the AI generated faces activity and then started his presentation on AI in transport. Finally, Cian presented his topic which was politics and social media. The presentation stretched out a bit longer than anticipated so we updated our timetable on the fly. After taking a break we came back to work on the second activity where the class came up with ideas for objects in their rooms having AI. The class presented and came out with some really interesting ideas such as Wardrobes that could organize your clothing, candles that could predict your presence and change fragrance, AI powered 3D printers and much more. After this activity we took a break before returning for the debate. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">The debate consisted of two topics and we broke the class up into four groups, telling the groups that they were either for or against a statement and that they’d have 5 minutes to make a case for their statement. The first topic was whether or not AI would be the best thing for humanity. The second topic was whether or not AI should be used for teaching students in the future. All groups engaged really well with their stance and came out with very convincing points.  In the end we took a poll in MS Teams and the class agreed that AI would not be the best thing for the future and that AI shouldn’t replace teachers in the future. It was quite telling in the research and through the seminar that there is some strong skepticism and concern regarding AI. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">We didn’t have time for the final activity but Shalvi explained it and shared the details in case anybody wanted to carry it out themselves. In the end we were very pleased with how the seminar went and had fun doing it. </p>

        <hr>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">I completed and submitted my Ethics application this week. Most of my thesis work at the time was being done via the workshop preparation. I was investigating AI in the workplace and looking at different ways AI was being used to improve worker efficiency, or in many cases, take the work of humans. I was learning about the augmented workforce which is the collaboration of humans and AI which is intended to reduce administrative workload. This is often suggested in a positive way to be a means of improving worker efficiency and not take jobs. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see past the fact that these technologies will reduce workload of individuals to the point where companies may require less staff. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">In the context of working from home, I found articles that discussed the boom in worker surveillance software since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic which forced many people to work from home. This software tracks keystrokes, time spent in front of the screen, emails sent and read, time spent on phone and more. It gathers this data and ultimately assigns a productivity score. I didn’t feel positively about this type of software and was disappointed to read that many of these companies had increased customer bases by over 40%. It was an example of some of the more intrusive ways that technology was being exploited in the workplace. This was a common trend amongst my research related to AI. During the debate, Ayoola made a very good point that I hadn’t specifically thought of. She was debating against the idea of AI being positive for humanity and mentioned that sometimes in a workplace you have people that elevate those around them, creating a good work atmosphere that naturally improves morale, comradery and workplace culture. An AI like the examples above would never capture these human elements and if it came down to cutting costs, may remove choose to let these people go. It further reinforced my feelings that these types of software aren’t positive for the work environment. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, Vinuta, Kade and Ashok were running the workshop and their Topic was stress. This was an interesting Topic and something that resonated with many of us in our class as we are starting to see more assignment deadlines approach. Their meditation session was a nice break and really demonstrated the positive impact of meditation. For the first activity we were prompted to pick a situation causing stress and come up with a device to help or a method we already use for handling the stress. I picked one related to losing sleep over stress and suggested an ambient light or sound device that might help someone dose off. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">Next, we got into groups to come up with a product that would be aimed at reducing stress together. I worked with Nileet and Arun on this. It didn’t take long for us to agree that we’d work on an app related to meditation. We all suggested features and ideas that we felt would be important for a device like this and then presented our idea to the class. </p>

Fortunately for my project, I didn’t feel that there were any big concerns about the type of participation I would require that might concern the ethics committee. I met with my supervisor Gabriela at the end of the week to review the Ethics application and there we made some adjustments and there were some parts for me to follow up on afterwards. Meanwhile my Literature review was still underway, and I was doing some research around Artificial Intelligence in the workspace. This was both for my Thesis and in preparation for the Seminar that I would be running with classmates based around Artificial Intelligence. </p>

For the Lab this week, Stephen, Arun, Nileet and Unwana would be taking over for their workshop session. Their topic was immersive technology. They started with a presentation on Virtual reality, Augmented reality, Haptics, looking at areas such as Healthcare and education as well as tangible technologies. It was an interesting and informative presentation. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">We then got into groups to come up with some ideas related to these immersive technologies with some prompts, ours being big organizations like Nike and Tesla. I worked with Fionn and Thomas, adding ideas to Mural before returning to the class to present our ideas. We then chose the idea that we’d like to develop further which was related to an article where VR had been proven to reduce cow anxiety and increase milk yields. We return to our groups and discussed how we could advance this technology, focusing primarily on using it in milking parlours. We then presented this to the class and received some feedback and a little further discussion about the idea. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week my Literature review was under way for my Thesis. I was now in a group for my seminar which would be based on AI and I would be hoping to tie that in with Working from home so that it would make up part of my literature review work as well as expanding my knowledge of the new technologies already on the horizon for working from home. I also reviewed a website sent to me by Gabriela which was a for devices called yoyo machines. They are designed to send non-verbal expressive messages to one another. They use lights and physical components to influence corresponding devices based on interaction. They’re an interesting way of making digital communication feel a bit more physical. </p>
        <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">On the Saturday before this week, Gabriela shared some interesting articles. Some of them covered digital Nomads as I had mentioned in our meeting that I was intrigued by the idea of working from anywhere, creating a portable workspace. I read an article titled ‘Digital Nomads’, which discussed the rise of digital nomads as technology has allowed for remote working, gig work and public workspaces. It looked into some of the negatives around this work style such as the difficulty of constantly integrating with changing clients who can all have different processes and culture, increased work overload, changing from workspace to workspace and the lack of benefits that comes with being a company employee such as healthcare. It acknowledged the shift from presence-based work to outcome-based work that we are starting to see in many organizations which has given rise to this way of work. </p>

        <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For the second part of the lab, we broke up into groups and came up with ideas for some wearable devices, allowing ourselves to come up with some absurd ideas.

        <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For the third part of the lab, we had some materials to create our own wearables. We had thread, conductive thread, an LED, a battery, Fabric and sewing needle. </p>
       <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">With these items we were to create a basic circuit that would light up the LED. We mostly created a little pouch for the battery that would touch off the positive and negative sides of the battery, passing power onto the LED to light it up.

            I spoke about my experience in Phong Nha, Vietnam which stood out to me as one of the 
            most scenically beautiful places that I’d ever been. Ayoola spoke about visiting her 
            mother in Switzerland and seeing Ensiedeln Monastery which stood out because of the 
            beautiful paintings and sculptures inside. She also noted that they stood out as being 
            baroque period artwork as she had recently studied art history and it enhanced her 
            appreciation for what she saw. Arun spoke about a walking Trail in the Grand Canyon which 
            was covered in snow at the time and he was taken aback at how vast it was. We then took 
            one of our group members experiences and discussed that with the entire class. I spoke 
            about Ayoolas experience and Arun spoke about mine. </p>
        
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">The next activity was to come up with 
            a product idea for a specific issue with each of the same groups having different topics. 
            Our topic was artists that are locked in with the pandemic and how VR could be utilized to
             help them. We had 20 minutes to come up with an idea and present that idea. We focused on 
             conventional painters as an example of artists that we would aim to help. Our idea was a 
             software that allows artists to model art exhibitions so they could showcase work and 
             collaborate with other artists or galleries. We wanted to emphasize that the artist would 
             be able to create virtual areas that could create an ambience to complement their work. 
             The artist would be able to set a scene and take advantage of VR to create a more immersive 
             experience and have freedom to make the exhibition space part of the artwork. There would 
             also be a feature within the system that allows attendees to order prints of the work to 
             support the artist. We then returned to the main group to present our ideas to the class.</p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For the first CS6022 Lab we had a presentation going 
            through some topics and areas of Human computer Interaction. We then were put into random 
            breakout rooms where we would discuss some ideas and topics of Human computer Interaction. 
            Some of us talked through our thesis ideas and we primarily discussed about the idea of 
            copying a consciousness of a person into a program as well as the idea of brain implants 
            that could be used to control systems. This was in response to an earlier question about 
            some of Elon Musk’s ideas in this area. Once the breakout room session ended, the entire 
            class started working in Mural, putting out ideas on post it notes that were interesting 
            topics relating to HCI. These topics were then bundled together based on relevance. 
            Two of the ideas I posted here were Self driving vehicles and Smart cities. I was quite 
            intrigued by Crypto currencies which I noticed was posted by a couple of classmates as I 
            think it’s an interesting technology. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">The Thesis topic that I had put 
            forward was investigating ways of improving the working from home experience. This 
            was something that I was personally motivated by as I had gone through the stark 
            change from office life to working from home that Covid lockdown caused. This left 
            the impression on me that the experience could be enhanced. There were aspects of 
            working from home that I liked and some that I did not and so I hoped that I might 
            be able to research and design something that tipped the scales in favor of working 
            from home. I could see the benefits socially and environmentally of working from 
            home and while my ideal future would be a hybrid of office and working from home, it 
            is something I see in our future. At this point we were still waiting to find out 
            who our Thesis supervisors would be. </p>
            
            <p style ="color:red" class ="desctiptiveText">Proposal:</p>
           <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> 
            In my research/design, I want to explore the current experience of working from 
            home. Many have been thrust into working from home with no preparation and although 
            many have proven to be able to work effectively, there is potential for enhancing the 
            experience. I’d like to understand the challenges and limitations that people are facing. 
            I want to design a product that improves and potentially broadens the experience in ways 
            that weren’t possible in an office environment. The general research/design problem is: 
           </p>
           <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> How can the working from home experience be improved?</p>
            
           <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> Some of the ideas I have in this area already are</p>
            <li>A product that acts as a workspace in any location, supporting the idea of ‘Work Anywhere’ rather than ‘Work from Home’</li> 
            
            <li>Creating a more visceral and engaging meeting experience, considering gamification within a meeting/workshop context.</li>
            
            <li>Portable note taking apparatus and software that cuts down on paper use.</li>
            
            <br>
            <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> I plan to do online research on different work environments that have been able to work from home. I will be interviewing people working in different departments in order to gather information on their experience. These will include workers in the tech industry and banking. Using the feedback, I’ll look for common trends and issues faced to understand where the main pain points are for working from home as well as considering new opportunities that working from home poses. Depending on the type of product being designed, I may use solid works to design the early physical prototype and if there is a digital interface, I’ll use either sketch or Figma to design.
            
            I want to research this area because I see it as an unavoidable change in our future. I’m welcome to the idea of working from home becoming more common, but I also feel that it’s lacking and can be a frustrating experience. This change has been and will continue to be positive for the environment with less need for public transport and relieving the pressure on overpopulated urban spaces. I’ve experienced the positive and negative sides of working from home and I think it’s an interesting area to assess with a focus on user experience. I’m also well positioned to research this as many of my friends have unexpectedly gone from an office environment to working from home as well as experiencing this myself. Rather than try and make the home an office, I think working from home could be evaluated as something new in its own right.
