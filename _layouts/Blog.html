        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week was quite busy as project due dates were all coming together. 
            I started writing my literature review this, going through my notes and returning to some of the articles. I found it 
            quite difficult to write in this way and referred back to out, lecture on writing the Literature review to try and ensure 
            that I was going about it the right way. I normally find a good flow when I write reports, but this was more of a challenge. 
            I found it difficult when the information is hinged on something else.  </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, the major focus was around the presentation of our Thesis to the 
            class. I was organizing information that I had researched in my Literature review and trying to tell a story with it. Based on the 
            information that I wanted to get across, I knew that it would be a challenge to try and get through the presentation in 10 minutes. 
            I had to adjust and cut some things out to make time. I still found that I could potentially run the risk of going over time. I realized 
            the best thing I could do would be practice and try to get through the center piece as quickly as possible. If I was to dwell on certain 
            topics, it would eat into the next one. On the day of the presentation, I was one of the later ones to speak. I spoke quite quickly as I had 
            planned and managed to get through it in approximately the right amount of time. At the end of the presentation, I asked the class what piece 
            of information they use their wearable devices for and got some feedback from a few. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">At this point, I was having difficulty with my Ethics application. The Ethics 
            committee were not willing to give final approval of something that I couldn’t describe (my prototype). I now had three ideas 
            in my mind for what I would be designing but I couldn’t see myself committing to anything until I had completed interviews. Only 
            one of my ideas required a physical device and the others would most likely be entirely software based. I started leaning towards 
            the idea of giving the description of a software system and the physical device as having approval for this would give me freedom in my choice. 
            I was still however apprehensive as I might decide on a completely new idea altogether, but I couldn’t know that at this time. 
            I started thinking about the presentation which would be happening next week, and what shape it might take. I was still doing some literature 
            review and was now considering my themes to be Flexibility, Communication and Working long hours, although I felt long hours and 
            flexibility were arguably both about time management. I was happy with this many themes as I felt there was overlap. 
            The three ideas I had at this point were:
            </p>
            
            <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"><b>Clock in System </b>– Allow workers to clock in using a device (something to give a distinctive sense of “My day has started”). 
                This would be coupled with a wearable device to track a user’s body information throughout the day. This would collect user time/work 
                data and also correlate that information with the wearable data, which could teach users about the impact that working patterns may have on 
                their health. It also could communicate with the user and have pomodoro based features that tell the user when to take breaks etc. </p>
            
            <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"><b>Asynchronous video messenger </b>– This was an idea that came as communication became a theme. This was focused on addressing the 
                contradiction of working flexible hours but also maximizing communication. My reading was showing the importance of face-to-face communication 
                and I was starting to think that some of the isolation, information underload and maybe even work overload problems could be a problem related 
                to chat communication, which appears to remove the human element of interaction. This would be a messenger system that allows users to 
                communicate via video recordings, and then respond within those recordings. For example, if I want to show an engineer that likes to start 
                work in the evening a design for an interface, I could record a demo and send it. The engineer would watch this, and they could stop the 
                video and record questions within the video, before resending their response. I imagined a single video turning into this constantly updating 
                piece of communication, as well as allowing for users to record messages or questions as presentations are taking place so that they can play 
                when the presenter is ready, unlike current systems where the users must wait for their moment to chime in. I understand that this couldn’t 
                remove the need for synchronous communication, but I saw it as a method for expanding the range of flexibility that is possible. </p>
            
            <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"><b>Management system for flexible workforce </b>– This was the idea I had fleshed out in the least detail, but I did feel that there if a 
                team were to fully embrace a flexible work plan, they would require a software to manage that. A system that finds touch points where coworkers 
                can engage with one another and ensure that they can be in sync. This would be a system that allows the user to tailor it the way they like to 
                do business. This was something that I personally see value in, but it was the idea I was least excited by at this point. I was concerned that 
                some of the project management software’s did this but I didn’t find an example related to my general use case, as most project management 
                software is task focused.</p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week my Literature review theme was continuing to expand. I started thinking 
            about the articles that I’d read and was making notes, mostly to distinguish my thoughts and reinforce my theme as it was developing. 
            Communication became the next theme which I felt needed to be included. Communication is obviously an essential part of making telework 
            successful and ICT’s (Information communication technology) are what really make it possible for most people. Communication naturally came 
            up as part of many of the articles I had read, not necessarily as a primary focus but certainly as an aspect of the teleworking experience. 
            As I thought about my themes relating to time and particularly the benefits of flexibility, I saw a contradiction. How can a workforce be 
            flexible but also communicate effectively? If two workers appreciate the flexibility to work on opposite hours of the clock, how could they 
            ever communicate? This is an extreme but even on less extreme cases this is still a challenge. There was also evidence that the current trend 
            in communication in teleworking environment is cause of stress and complements a sense of role ambiguity, information underload, isolation and 
            potentially work overload. Communication seemed to be naturally intwined in the other themes and in some cases appeared to be an attribute of 
            time management issues. I decided that I would do some further reading about communication and particularly about the efficiency of the technology 
            that is currently in use today.</p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week I was getting deeper into my Literature review as well as thinking about the structure that it was starting to take. 
            At the earlier stages of the Literature review I was expecting that working long hours would be the main theme. This was partly an
            assumption based on personal experience and also based on some non-academic articles that emphasised this. As I started getting into 
            more academic articles, the value of flexibility, especially related to work life balance became a more prominent theme. I started looking 
            further at this and there seemed to be a number of empirical evaluations that reinforced the message that this was a positive thing for both 
            employees and employers. At this point I would have said that my theme was still in the general context of time but now had taken on a broader 
            view rather than just work hours. I realised that I was expecting certain things before reading the literature and needed to let go of any 
            preconceived ideas and embrace what I was finding in terms of the theme. Looking back on some of my previous research, particularly digital 
            nomads, I realised flexibility was as much a part of those articles, as they are using flexibility to their full advantage and are an example 
            of an extreme flexible working model. </p>

     <H5 style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">Thesis</H5>
     <hr>
     <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For my Thesis research, I returned to some of the papers about digital Nomads that I received in Week 3. I originally wanted to look at digital nomads as a means of exploring the idea of working anywhere and quickly realised that it had some interesting parallels with the experience of working from home where lines between life and work become blurred. I read a paper called ‘The Freedom Trap’ which focused in on the illusion of freedom that digital nomads seek which ironically results in more difficulty separating life from work. The digital Nomads have to go to great lengths to create a distinction between the two and in some cases end up working longer and more intensely from the pressure to maintain their brand. The digital Nomads are often forced to intensely monitor time in order to find time for their own life. It looked at how digital Nomads are dissolving boundaries between travel, work and leisure by going to tourist spots and trying to work in them. The digital Nomads often romanticize the lifestyle making some interviews less reliable as they tend to focus on the positive aspects. The paper did an Ethnographic study which surprisingly led to disciplining strategies being an integral part of the results which was a surprise to the Nomads and the investigator. </p>
       <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> The article research started to identify that digital Nomads indirectly seek out structure and found that they couldn’t escape some of the tropes and values of the conventional office space. Shared office space were often considered an essential aspect for digital Nomads to be productive, creating a physical boundary between work and leisure as well as opting to primarily use Laptops over mobile devices as a less distracting method of working. There was a sense that productivity is of the upmost importance and structure was an essential part of achieving this. It pointed out that working late or into the evening was what they aimed to avoid but this wasn’t always the case based on workload and colleague time zones. The paper also noted a taboo around taking calls in the public workspace and that although Digital Nomads opted for this public workspace, they would often avoid interaction and would prioritise workspaces where they weren’t sitting across from others. The paper also found that some digital nomads that were travelling and working alone experienced a strong sense of isolation and that when alone it was often harder to find delineation between work and leisure. They found that couples worked with a better sense of structure and work life division as the partners understood one another’s rhythm and would often intervene if they felt the other was working too hard and reminded them to take a break. They also noted that Nomads often changed their view on deadlines after time on the road, understanding the sense of structure that it can create. This is something the more entrepreneurial Nomads couldn’t enjoy, requiring self-imposed time management techniques. Some used a wide variety of project management techniques, including Agile,Footnote3 SprintsFootnote4 and timeboxing.Footnote5. They paper noted the lengths that digital nomads went to in order to avoid distractions with one participant having gotten a programmer to write a system that would lock him out of certain apps until he had put down 4.5 hours of work. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, the topic was smart cities, and it was run by Ayoola, Savannah, Thomas and Arun. This would be the final class workshop run by students. Ayoola spoke about INSERT TOPIC, Savannah spoke about INSERT TOPIC, Thomas spoke about Neuralink and finally Arunraj spoke about Finance relating to smart cities. The presentation explored some interesting topics in relation to smart cities. After the presentation, we moved into some activities. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">I worked with Kade and Cian for the group activities where we had to come up with problems based in urban areas. We then had to agree on the one issue we’d like to solve. We agreed that transport and in particular issues related to cycling would be our topic. The next activity was a continuation of this where we had to create an empathy map based on our issue. Cian had to leave at this point so myself and Kade came up with an empathy map based on a character named Laura who was cycling to work in Dublin city every day. Finally, we worked on creating a product solution to our problem and then coming up with a story based on this product as well as potential future enhancements. We settled on a smart helmet which would direct cyclists through the safest route in the least distracting way, makes cyclists more visible, has indicators and could one day be integrated with EEG Sensors. The seminar was really engaging, and the activities used some interesting methods for exploring ideas. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, it was our turn to host the workshop. My group included Shalvi, Fionn and Cian. 
            Our topic was Artificial Intelligence. I chose to work on this topic as I believed it could have some interesting material related to working 
            from home. We started working together on Miro, a similar software to mural where we posted some topics and presentation flow ideas. We used 
            this to agree on topics that we would each cover in the presentation. I decided to look at the workplace in general as this is a big topic in 
            AI and I felt that this would still be interesting in relation to my Thesis. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">Once we’d agreed on our presentation topic’s we started discussing the activities further. 
            We wanted to try and do something new this week and considering that AI can be a divisive topic, we organized a debate. We added a short 
            activity that prompted attendees to look around the room, pick an object, imagine it had a mind or autonomy and talk about how it might behave. 
            During our planning sessions we discussed some deepfake software and a website that could make fake faces using AI. We were taken aback at how real 
            some of the faces looked so we thought it would be a fun activity to show faces and ask the class if they thought they were human, or AI generated. 
            Finally, we had an activity that prompted participants to make prototypes using paper that we would do depending on time. </p>

            prepared for everything. Later that day we kicked off the workshop. Shalvi presented first covering the introduction and AI in UX. I followed 
            and presented about AI in the workplace. Fionn followed, and started with the AI generated faces activity. He then started his presentation on AI in transport. 
            Finally, Cian presented his topic which was politics and social media. Our collective presentation stretched out a bit longer than anticipated so 
            we updated our timetable on the fly. After taking a break we came back to work on the second activity where the class came up with ideas 
            for objects in their rooms having AI. The class presented and came out with some really interesting ideas such as Wardrobes that could organize 
            your clothing, candles that could predict your presence and change fragrance, AI powered 3D printers and much more. After this activity we took a 
            break before returning for the debate. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">The debate consisted of two topics and we broke the class up into four groups, telling 
            the groups that they were either for or against a statement and that they’d have 5 minutes to make a case for their statement. 
            The first topic was whether or not AI would be the best thing for humanity. The second topic was whether or not AI should be used for 
            teaching students in the future. All groups engaged really well with their stance and came out with very convincing points.  
            In the end we took a poll in MS Teams and the class agreed that AI would not be the best thing for the future and that AI shouldn’t 
            replace teachers in the future. It was quite telling in the research and through the seminar that there is some strong skepticism and 
            concern regarding AI. </p>

        <hr>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">I completed and submitted my Ethics application this week. Most of my thesis work at the time was being done via the workshop preparation. I was investigating AI in the workplace and looking at different ways AI was being used to improve worker efficiency, or in many cases, take the work of humans. I was learning about the augmented workforce which is the collaboration of humans and AI which is intended to reduce administrative workload. This is often suggested in a positive way to be a means of improving worker efficiency and not take jobs. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see past the fact that these technologies will reduce workload of individuals to the point where companies may require less staff. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">In the context of working from home, I found articles that discussed the boom in worker surveillance software since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic which forced many people to work from home. This software tracks keystrokes, time spent in front of the screen, emails sent and read, time spent on phone and more. It gathers this data and ultimately assigns a productivity score. I didn’t feel positively about this type of software and was disappointed to read that many of these companies had increased customer bases by over 40%. It was an example of some of the more intrusive ways that technology was being exploited in the workplace. This was a common trend amongst my research related to AI. During the debate, Ayoola made a very good point that I hadn’t specifically thought of. She was debating against the idea of AI being positive for humanity and mentioned that sometimes in a workplace you have people that elevate those around them, creating a good work atmosphere that naturally improves morale, comradery and workplace culture. An AI like the examples above would never capture these human elements and if it came down to cutting costs, may remove choose to let these people go. It further reinforced my feelings that these types of software aren’t positive for the work environment. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, Vinuta, Kade and Ashok were running the workshop and their Topic was stress. This was an interesting Topic and something that resonated with many of us in our class as we are starting to see more assignment deadlines approach. Their meditation session was a nice break and really demonstrated the positive impact of meditation. For the first activity we were prompted to pick a situation causing stress and come up with a device to help or a method we already use for handling the stress. I picked one related to losing sleep over stress and suggested an ambient light or sound device that might help someone dose off. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">Next, we got into groups to come up with a product that would be aimed at reducing stress together. I worked with Nileet and Arun on this. It didn’t take long for us to agree that we’d work on an app related to meditation. We all suggested features and ideas that we felt would be important for a device like this and then presented our idea to the class. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week, I began filling out my Ethics application form. Fortunately for my project, I didn’t feel that there were any big concerns about the type of participation I would require that might concern the ethics committee. I met with my supervisor Gabriela at the end of the week to review the Ethics application and there we made some adjustments and there were some parts for me to follow up on afterwards. Meanwhile my Literature review was still underway, and I was doing some research around Artificial Intelligence in the workspace. This was both for my Thesis and in preparation for the Seminar that I would be running with classmates based around Artificial Intelligence. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For our Lecture this week, we learned about Data collection in regard to our Thesis. This went over some of the benefits and limitations of some of the different methods that could be used. For the Lab this week, Stephen, Arun, Nileet and Unwana would be taking over for their workshop session. Their topic was immersive technology. They started with a presentation on Virtual reality, Augmented reality, Haptics, looking at areas such as Healthcare and education as well as tangible technologies. It was an interesting and informative presentation. </p>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">We then got into groups to come up with some ideas related to these immersive technologies with some prompts, ours being big organizations like Nike and Tesla. I worked with Fionn and Thomas, adding ideas to Mural before returning to the class to present our ideas. We then chose the idea that we’d like to develop further which was related to an article where VR had been proven to reduce cow anxiety and increase milk yields. We return to our groups and discussed how we could advance this technology, focusing primarily on using it in milking parlours. We then presented this to the class and received some feedback and a little further discussion about the idea. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">This week my Literature review was under way for my Thesis. I was now in a group for my seminar which would be based on AI and I would be hoping to tie that in with Working from home so that it would make up part of my literature review work as well as expanding my knowledge of the new technologies already on the horizon for working from home. I also reviewed a website sent to me by Gabriela which was a for devices called yoyo machines. They are designed to send non-verbal expressive messages to one another. They use lights and physical components to influence corresponding devices based on interaction. They’re an interesting way of making digital communication feel a bit more physical. </p>
        <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">On the Saturday before this week, Gabriela shared some interesting articles. Some of them covered digital Nomads as I had mentioned in our meeting that I was intrigued by the idea of working from anywhere, creating a portable workspace. I read an article titled ‘Digital Nomads’, which discussed the rise of digital nomads as technology has allowed for remote working, gig work and public workspaces. It looked into some of the negatives around this work style such as the difficulty of constantly integrating with changing clients who can all have different processes and culture, increased work overload, changing from workspace to workspace and the lack of benefits that comes with being a company employee such as healthcare. It acknowledged the shift from presence-based work to outcome-based work that we are starting to see in many organizations which has given rise to this way of work. </p>

            different methods and use cases for wearable devices as well as about the history of how they progressed over the years. </p>
        <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For the second part of the lab, we broke up into groups and came up with ideas for some 
            wearable devices, allowing ourselves to come up with some absurd ideas. We used a random word generator ‘’ as inspiration for these ideas. 
            I worked with Fionn on this and we then presented some of the ideas we came up with, flagging the ones we considered the best. </p>
        <br>
        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">For the third part of the lab, we had some materials to create our own wearables.

            that focused on cultural heritage as well as looking at some technology that is utilized 
            in areas to enhance the experience and information flow of cultural heritage spaces. 
            After a presentation from our Lecturer Gabriella on some of the examples of cultural 
            heritage that were most personally profound and memorable to her, we were given an activity 
            to do something similar. We were split into groups where we would discuss one example of 
            cultural heritage that stood out to us as most memorable and to speak about the details 
            of the experience as well as what made it so special. We also were to mention any related

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">I was in Group 4 with Ayoola and Arun. 
            I spoke about my experience in Phong Nha, Vietnam which stood out to me as one of the 
            most scenically beautiful places that I’d ever been. Ayoola spoke about visiting her 
            mother in Switzerland and seeing Ensiedeln Monastery which stood out because of the 
            beautiful paintings and sculptures inside. She also noted that they stood out as being 
            baroque period artwork as she had recently studied art history and it enhanced her 
            appreciation for what she saw. Arun spoke about a walking Trail in the Grand Canyon which 
            was covered in snow at the time and he was taken aback at how vast it was. We then took 
            one of our group members experiences and discussed that with the entire class. I spoke 
            about Ayoolas experience and Arun spoke about mine. </p>

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">The next activity was to come up with 
            a product idea for a specific issue with each of the same groups having different topics. 
            Our topic was artists that are locked in with the pandemic and how VR could be utilized to
             help them. We had 20 minutes to come up with an idea and present that idea. We focused on 
             conventional painters as an example of artists that we would aim to help. Our idea was a 
             software that allows artists to model art exhibitions so they could showcase work and 
             collaborate with other artists or galleries. We wanted to emphasize that the artist would 
             be able to create virtual areas that could create an ambience to complement their work. 
             The artist would be able to set a scene and take advantage of VR to create a more immersive 
             experience and have freedom to make the exhibition space part of the artwork. There would 
             also be a feature within the system that allows attendees to order prints of the work to 
             support the artist. We then returned to the main group to present our ideas to the class.</p>

            breakout rooms where we would discuss some ideas and topics of Human computer Interaction. 
            Some of us talked through our thesis ideas and we primarily discussed about the idea of 
            copying a consciousness of a person into a program as well as the idea of brain implants 
            that could be used to control systems. This was in response to an earlier question about 
            some of Elon Musk’s ideas in this area. Once the breakout room session ended, the entire 
            class started working in Mural, putting out ideas on post it notes that were interesting 
            topics relating to HCI. These topics were then bundled together based on relevance. 
            Two of the ideas I posted here were Self driving vehicles and Smart cities. I was quite 
            intrigued by Crypto currencies which I noticed was posted by a couple of classmates as I

        <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText">The Thesis topic that I had put 
            forward was investigating ways of improving the working from home experience. This 
            was something that I was personally motivated by as I had gone through the stark 
            change from office life to working from home that Covid lockdown caused. This left 
            the impression on me that the experience could be enhanced. There were aspects of 
            working from home that I liked and some that I did not and so I hoped that I might 
            be able to research and design something that tipped the scales in favor of working 
            from home. I could see the benefits socially and environmentally of working from 
            home and while my ideal future would be a hybrid of office and working from home, it 
            is something I see in our future. At this point we were still waiting to find out 
            who our Thesis supervisors would be. </p>
            
            <p style ="color:red" class ="desctiptiveText">Proposal:</p>
           <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> 
            In my research/design, I want to explore the current experience of working from 
            home. Many have been thrust into working from home with no preparation and although 
            many have proven to be able to work effectively, there is potential for enhancing the 
            experience. I’d like to understand the challenges and limitations that people are facing. 
            I want to design a product that improves and potentially broadens the experience in ways 
            that weren’t possible in an office environment. The general research/design problem is: 
           </p>
           <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> How can the working from home experience be improved?</p>
            
           <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> Some of the ideas I have in this area already are</p>
            <li>A product that acts as a workspace in any location, supporting the idea of ‘Work Anywhere’ rather than ‘Work from Home’</li> 
            
            <li>Creating a more visceral and engaging meeting experience, considering gamification within a meeting/workshop context.</li>
            
            <li>Portable note taking apparatus and software that cuts down on paper use.</li>
            
            <br>
            <p style ="color:black" class ="desctiptiveText"> I plan to do online research on different work environments that have been able to work from home. I will be interviewing people working in different departments in order to gather information on their experience. These will include workers in the tech industry and banking. Using the feedback, I’ll look for common trends and issues faced to understand where the main pain points are for working from home as well as considering new opportunities that working from home poses. Depending on the type of product being designed, I may use solid works to design the early physical prototype and if there is a digital interface, I’ll use either sketch or Figma to design.
            
            I want to research this area because I see it as an unavoidable change in our future. I’m welcome to the idea of working from home becoming more common, but I also feel that it’s lacking and can be a frustrating experience. This change has been and will continue to be positive for the environment with less need for public transport and relieving the pressure on overpopulated urban spaces. I’ve experienced the positive and negative sides of working from home and I think it’s an interesting area to assess with a focus on user experience. I’m also well positioned to research this as many of my friends have unexpectedly gone from an office environment to working from home as well as experiencing this myself. Rather than try and make the home an office, I think working from home could be evaluated as something new in its own right.
